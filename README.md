Here's the rephrased version:

# **Getting Started with Create React App**  

This project was initialized using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).  

## **Available Commands**  

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:  

### **`npm start`**  

Starts the application in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view it.  

The page automatically refreshes when you make changes.  
You may also see linting errors in the console.  

### **`npm test`**  

Runs the test suite in interactive watch mode.  
For more details, check the [testing guide](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).  

### **`npm run build`**  

Generates a production-ready build in the `build` directory.  
React is optimized for performance in production mode.  

The build output is minified, and file names include content hashes.  
Your application is now ready for deployment!  

For deployment instructions, refer to the [deployment guide](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).  

### **`npm run eject`**  

🚨 **Warning: This is irreversible!** Once you eject, you cannot undo this action.  

If the default setup doesn't meet your requirements, you can run `eject` to gain full control over the configuration. This will remove the single build dependency and copy all the configuration files (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) directly into your project.  

All other scripts will continue to work, but they will reference the copied configuration instead. Once ejected, you are responsible for maintaining the setup.  

Using `eject` is **optional**—the default configuration is ideal for small to medium-sized projects. However, if you need extensive customization, this tool allows you to modify the setup as needed.  

## **Further Resources**
